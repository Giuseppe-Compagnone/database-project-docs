# Endpoints

The website will have various endpoints that will retrieve information from the database.

The basic structure of an endpoint is as follows:

```js
export const registerTeacher = async (
  name,
  surname,
  email,
  password,
  specialization
) => {
  const [rows] = await pool.query(
    `
    INSERT INTO TEACHER (name, surname, email, password, specialization)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  `,
    [name, surname, email, password, specialization]
  );
  return rows;
};

app.post("/signup/teacher", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await registerTeacher(
      req.body.name,
      req.body.surname,
      req.body.email,
      req.body.password,
      req.body.specialization
    );
    res.send("Registered successfully");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    res.status(500).send("Error on registration");
  }
});
```

So, as we can see, protection against SQL injection is implemented using placeholders (?) and error handling is implemented for all endpoints. With that said, let's see the details:

## SignUp Teacher

This endpoint is used to register a teacher.

```sql
    INSERT INTO TEACHER ( name, surname, email, password, specialization)
    VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

## SignUp student

This endpoint is used to register a student.

```sql
     INSERT INTO STUDENT ( name, surname, email, password, performance_avg, other_details)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 0, ?)

```

## Login

This endpoint is used to log in to the website. There are two separate endpoints for students and teachers.

```sql

SELECT * FROM STUDENT
WHERE email = ?
AND password = ?


SELECT * FROM TEACHER
WHERE email = ?
AND password = ?

```

## Get Courses For Students

```sql
    SELECT c.course_id,c.title,c.description,c.num_enrollments,c.start_date,c.end_date,CONCAT(t.name , ' ', t.surname)  as responsible_teacher_id
    FROM TEACHER as t
    INNER JOIN COURSE as c
    ON t.teacher_id = c.responsible_teacher_id
    INNER JOIN ENROLLMENT as e
    ON c.course_id = e.course_id
    WHERE e.student_id = ?
```

## Get Courses For Teachers

This endpoint retrieves all the courses created by a teacher.

```sql
    SELECT c.course_id,c.title,c.description,c.num_enrollments,c.start_date,c.end_date,CONCAT(t.name , ' ', t.surname)  as responsible_teacher_id
    FROM TEACHER as t
    INNER JOIN COURSE as c
    ON t.teacher_id = c.responsible_teacher_id
    WHERE c.responsible_teacher_id = ?
```

## Create Course

This endpoint is used to create a new course.

```sql

# Get Course

```sql
    SELECT p.performance_id,p.student_id,p.evaluation,p.completion_date,c.title as course_id

    INNER JOIN COURSE as c
    ON c.course_id = p.course_id
    WHERE student_id = ?
```
