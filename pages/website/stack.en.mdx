    # Technology Stack

Now, let's define the structure of a web interface that allows users to interact with the database. You can access the interface <a className="cta" href="https://elearning-system.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>. First, let's define the technology stack we'll be using:

## Frontend

### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). It's used to create reusable components that compose the graphical interface of a web application.

### SCSS

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a CSS extension that provides advanced features such as variables, nesting, and mixins. It's used to write more organized and maintainable CSS stylesheets.

### Webpack

## Backend

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment on the server side that allows executing JavaScript code on the server. It's used for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

### Express

Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs and web applications. It provides a set of useful features for handling HTTP requests, routing, response management, and more.

## Database

### MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system widely used for storing and managing data in a structured manner, enabling efficient read and write operations.

### SQL Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with relational databases. It's used to define, manipulate, and retrieve data within a MySQL database.
