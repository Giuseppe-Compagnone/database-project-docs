**IS_ENROLLED_IN**:

- **Participating Entities**: STUDENT, ENROLLMENT
- **Description**: This relationship represents the link between students and the courses they are enrolled in. Each student can be enrolled in multiple courses, hence it's a 1-N (one-to-many) relationship.

**HAS_ENROLLED**:

- **Participating Entities**: COURSE, ENROLLMENT
- **Description**: Indicates which students are enrolled in a particular course. A course can have many enrolled students, but a student is enrolled in only one course at a time. Hence, it's a N-1 (many-to-one) relationship from course to students.

**TEACHES**:

- **Participating Entities**: TEACHER, COURSE
- **Description**: This relationship links teachers to the courses they teach. A teacher can teach multiple courses, but a course is taught by only one teacher. So, it's a N-1 (many-to-one) relationship from teacher to courses.

**INCLUDES**:

- **Participating Entities**: COURSE, COURSE_MATERIAL
- **Description**: Indicates which educational materials are included in a particular course. A course can include many educational materials, but an educational material can be included in only one course. So, it's a N-1 (many-to-one) relationship from course to educational materials.

**HAS_PERFORMANCE**:

- **Participating Entities**: STUDENT, STUDENT_PERFORMANCE
- **Description**: This relationship associates students with their performance in courses. Each student can have many performances across different courses, while each performance is associated with only one student. So, it's a 1-N (one-to-many) relationship from students to their performances.
