# Database Structure Update

Following the previous considerations, we will make some changes to the database structure to include redundancies:

- **"num_enrollments"**: number of course enrollments
- **"performance_avg"**: student's average grade

## Entity-Relationship Model Update

erDiagram
    STUDENT ||--|{ STUDENT_PERFORMANCE : "has performance"
    STUDENT ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "is enrolled in"
    COURSE ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "has enrolled"
    TEACHER ||--o{ COURSE : teaches
    COURSE ||--o{ COURSE_MATERIAL : includes

    STUDENT {
        student_id INT PK
        name VARCHAR
        surname VARCHAR
        email VARCHAR
        password VARCHAR
        performance_avg DECIMAL
        other_details TEXT
    }

    COURSE {
        course_id INT PK
        title VARCHAR
        description TEXT
        responsible_teacher_id INT FK
        num_enrollments INT
        start_date DATE
        end_date DATE
    }

    TEACHER {
        teacher_id INT PK
        name VARCHAR
        surname VARCHAR
        email VARCHAR
        password VARCHAR
        specialization VARCHAR
    }

    COURSE_MATERIAL {
        material_id INT PK
        title VARCHAR
        description TEXT
        file_or_link VARCHAR
        publication_date DATE
        course_id INT FK
    }

    ENROLLMENT {
        enrollment_id INT PK
        student_id INT FK
        course_id INT FK
        enrollment_date DATE
        status VARCHAR
    }

    STUDENT_PERFORMANCE {
        performance_id INT PK
        student_id INT FK
        course_id INT FK
        evaluation DECIMAL
        completion_date DATE
    }
```

## Logical Model Update

STUDENT (student_id PK, name, surname, email, password, performance_avg, other_details)\
COURSE (course_id PK, title, description, responsible_teacher_id FK, performance_avg, start_date, end_date)\
TEACHER (teacher_id PK, name, surname, email, password, specialization)\
COURSE_MATERIAL (material_id PK, title, description, file_or_link, publication_date, course_id FK)\
ENROLLMENT (enrollment_id PK, student_id FK, course_id FK, enrollment_date, status)\
STUDENT_PERFORMANCE (performance_id PK, student_id FK, course_id FK, evaluation, completion_date)

## Considerations

The redundancies we have added will be managed automatically by the database. In fact, later on, we will see the implementation of triggers that will take care of updating these attributes.
