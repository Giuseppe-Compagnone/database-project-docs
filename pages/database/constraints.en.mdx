# Integrity Constraints

Constraints not expressible by the E/R schema:

- **Constraint on the "evaluation" attribute in Student Performance**:
  Ensure that the value of the "evaluation" attribute falls between 0 and 30, in line with the grading scale expected for courses.

- **Constraint on the enrollment date in Enrollment**:
  Prevent the enrollment date from being after the course end date or before the course start date.

- **Constraint on student emails in Student**:
  Ensure that students' email addresses are unique within the system, avoiding duplicates.

- **Constraint on teacher emails in Teacher**:
  Similarly to students, ensure the uniqueness of teachers' email addresses.

- **Constraint on the uniqueness of course titles**:
  Avoid having courses with the same title to prevent ambiguity and facilitate search.

- **Constraint on the "status" attribute in Enrollment**:
  Ensure that the enrollment status is one of the allowed values, such as "active," "completed," "in progress," etc.

Applying these specific database integrity constraints will help ensure data integrity and consistency, supporting the proper functioning of the online course management system.
