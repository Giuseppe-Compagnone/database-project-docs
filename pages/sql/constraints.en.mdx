# Constraints

We have previously defined some constraints, and now it's time to apply them. Most of them will be implemented as constraints:

## Constraint on the "evaluation" attribute in Student Performance

The evaluation must be between 18 and 30.

```sql
ALTER TABLE STUDENT_PERFORMANCE
ADD CONSTRAINT evaluation_range_constraint CHECK (evaluation >= 18 AND evaluation <= 30);
```

## Constraint on user emails in Student and Teacher

User emails must be unique within the database.

```sql
ALTER TABLE STUDENT
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_student_email_constraint UNIQUE (email);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE TEACHER
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_teacher_email_constraint UNIQUE (email);
```

## Constraint on the uniqueness of course titles

There should not be multiple courses with the same title.

```sql
ALTER TABLE COURSE
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_course_title_constraint UNIQUE (title);
```

## Constraint on the "status" attribute in Enrollment

The status attribute can only have the following values: 'active', 'completed', 'in progress'.

```sql
ALTER TABLE ENROLLMENT
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_enrollment_status_constraint CHECK (status IN ('active', 'completed', 'in progress'));
```
